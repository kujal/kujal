Isochronic maps are maps that depict areas of equal travel time. They are often used in urban planning to improve the efficiency of transportation.

The Helsinki Regional Transport Authority ([Helsingin seudun liikenne, HSL](https://www.hsl.fi/)) provides a vast amount of open data to the public through [opendata.fi](https://www.opendata.fi/data/en_GB/organization/helsingin-seudun-liikenne). I have used this data to create an isochronic map.
